                	<p>Back in March 2012 I hyped up Highlight something fierce. I thought it was going to be the next big app. I was wrong. Should have picked Snapchat (which I didn’t see coming because I personally don’t need it very much). Highlight just hasn’t proven to be very addictive to either me or my friends. We talk about it often. I keep running it. Now, what did they do right? They did fix their battery issues. It doesn’t put a major strain on my battery anymore. It does have some users, it’s just that the user count isn’t going up very fast and the UTILITY hasn’t gotten to where I thought it would.</p>

					<p>Why not? It has the chat room problem. What is the chat room problem? I wrote back in 2009 that I’ve noticed that chat rooms get less interesting over time.Why? Because chat rooms drag in new users (even interesting new users reduce the quality of an already-existing conversation). Eventually they drag in uninteresting users, even spammers and trolls.</p>

					<p>Highlight hasn’t gotten that bad, but in talking with tons of users about it I think it tried to solve the wrong social problem: we simply don’t want to meet random people. If we did want to do that we’d just walk up to random people in the street and introduce ourselves.This is why it has a chat room problem: when Highlight started out it was full of interesting people. Mostly A list bloggers and people at SXSW. In other words, people like me. People that I’d hang out with anyway.</p>

                	<p>While professional skeptics have been skeptical, the sheer audaciousness – and frankly, awesomeness – of Amazon’s drone proposal has attracted a near unanimous outpouring of amazement and adulation, at least if my Twitter feed is to be believed. It is the purest expression of the unbounded vision Jeff Bezos has. The benefits are manifold (even if the drones never actually come to pass).</p>

                	<p>Feel free to ignore anyone making snarky comments about China’s average monthly wage being the same as the price of an iPhone 5C. The two pertinent facts about China are that:</p>
					<p>- There is tremendous income disparity</p>
					<p>- There are a TON of people</p>
					<p>So while many Western markets may have a greater percentage of the population that can afford an iPhone, the absolute number of Chinese who are potential customers is very high as well.</p>

                	<p>In 1995 I remember waiting in lines to buy Windows 95. It effectively ended the design lead Apple had for 11 years in personal computers. From then on Microsoft had both the thought leadership and the market share. Apple ended up with less than 10% market share. Microsoft had most of the rest.</p>

                	<p>I get it. Smart phones and tablets sure are convenient. Any question we have is answered in seconds. Plans with friends are made with minimal effort. Kids are quiet and obedient when the promise of screen time looms ahead. But, things are starting to get a little out of control. About a year ago I made the choice to put my phone down more often. If I’m spending time with the kids in the toyroom or going on a date with my husband, my phone is out of sight.  And, I never look at it while I am driving. I know that someday my kids will have a smart phone, and I won’t want them ignoring me while they are staring at it, so I need to set an example for them now.</p>
